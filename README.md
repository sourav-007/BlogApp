# BlogApp (Multi-role Based Blog Web Application)

This is a multi-role based blog web application designed to cater for both regular users and admin using the MERN stack. The platform allows users to view blogs, search blogs based on the title, tags and category, save their favourite blogs, comment on them, and also edit their created comments. On the other hand, admin has full CRUD capabilities to manage blogs.
